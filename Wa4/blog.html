                    <p>For this first Lab we learned the basics of simple circuits. First I used my multimeter to test
                        my 9V
                        battery, I got a reading of 9.1V.</p> <img class="small-photo"

                    <p>I
                        then set up my power delivery board. I tested my left power line, and got a reading of 3.3V.</p>

                    I then tested the right 5V power rail, getting a reading of 5V.

                        I have my own large electornics kit that I've used over the years and unfortunatley I only had a
                        220&Omega; resistor. Please forgvie me, I promise you im a circuit god. 3.3V divided by
                        220&Omega;s,
                        this
                        gave me 15mA which I knew was still above the
                        forward current. I then wired up my circuit with the 220&Omega; resistor wired to the cathode
                        and
                        the
                        ground line, I then used a jumper between the power rail and the anode.</p>

                    <p>
                        If we wanted to power the LED with a 5v source, with a goal of 25mA, then we would need a
                        200&Omega;
                        resitor, this is perfect as the lowest resistor I currently have is 220&Omega;.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I switched back to the 3.3V circuit,
                        then added a button in series to control the power flow.</p>

                    <p>For this I created a circuit that would naturally power the LED, and then I added a button in
                        parallel so that when pressed, the circuit 'shorts' and the power goes through the button
                        instead.

                    <p>Before I started this project I made sure to Ground myself as I shocked myself earlier today on a
                        door. Thankfully my arduino has a plastic base so it can't be shorted on a metal surface. I
                        already have the IDE downloaded so everything was set up. I plugged in my Arduino UNO R4,
                        updated my libraries, then selected the right board. I then opened the blink example and
                        uploaded it to my arduino</p>

                    <h2 class="part-header">Part 2:</h2>
                    <p>Now I want to make an external LED blink. I choose pin 10 and set it's pinmode to output. I then
                        wrote my loop so that it sets digital write pin 10 to high for a second, then to digital write
                        low for a
                        second. I then started to make my circuit, I chose a Red LED and connected it's cathode to the
                        ground via a 220&Omega; resistor. With my arduino unplugged, I connected the ground pin the my
                        breadboard ground using a jumper wire, I repeated this with the 5v connections. My last step was
                        to connect the Annode to the power rail, I did this, uploaded my program. Once it was uploaded I
                        realized my silly mistake, I had connected the LED to the Arduino 5v line, when in reality it
                        should've been pin 10. I swapped the pins and everything worked!</p>

                    <p>I then decided to make a shorter, uneven blink. I decided to have it on longer than it was
                        off so
                        I set the low delay to 500ms, this wasn't super noticeable so I reduced to to 100ms.</p>

                    <h2 class="part-header">Part 3:</h2>

                    <p>Now we need to convert this to control and LED through button press. Based on the diagram in
                        our
                        lab document, pin 7 will normally be 0V as it's pulled down to ground, but due to the
                        extreme
                        resistance, whenever the button is pressed it will go to 5V. I will use this to control the
                        LED.
                        If we didn't have a connection to ground, then the pin will be floating and will pickup
                        random
                        electrical interference. Additionally, if the button loop had no resistor in series, then it
                        would easily short circuit and generate a ton of heat. So for my setup, I connected the
                        button
                        to pin 9 and to ground through a 10k&Omega; resistor. I then connected the 5V rail to the
                        other
                        side of the button.
                        For the LED, I connected the cathode to ground through a 220&Omega; resistor, and the anode
                        to
                        pin 10. </p>

                    <img class="small-photo" src="../photos/lab-2/Button-setup.JPG" alt="Simple Circuit diagram">


                    <p>
                        I then wrote the code so that each loop we check the state of the button and then apply
                        it to the LED via pin 10. I had to set pin 9 to input so we can detect the button state. I
                        then
                        used digitalRead(9), to get the pin state and then used digitalWrite(10, buttonState) to set
                        the
                        LED state. I also added some print statments to print the button state just to make sure
                        everything was working. I made sure to add a slight delay to my loop to avoid any bugs.
                        unfortunatley when I uplaoded the code the LED was on which shouldnt be the case, I added
                        some
                        print statments to give me an idea of what section of the if statment I was in. After this I
                        realized that I was passing the pin number to the if statment, rather than my pinState bool
                        which I only intialized. After fixing this my circuit worked perfectly!

                    <p>For the serial output part of this assignment, I choose to print the message "hiii prof" to
                        the
                        serial monitor. At first I used a lowercase 's' in Serial so it didn't work but after fixing
                        this
                        it worked perfectly.</p>

                    <p>I modified my intital code and instead nested my pinState detection within a while loop, this
                        ensures that waiting is only printed once. </p>

                    <p>I noticed that the button oscillates when I press it once, this is due to the speed that we
                        check
                        the button state, how long im holding the button and the fact the program loops as soon as a
                        press is detected. If I added a variable that checks if the
                        button has been pressed, then i can apply that so that I stay within the while loop.</p>

                    <h2 class="part-header">Part 4:</h2>

                    <p>I now need to program a game in which an LED will turn on after a random time interval, the
                        player will try to press the button as soon as they notice. I setup my program so that it
                        welcomes you within the setup, then inside the loop is all my game round logic. I've used
                        random
                        before so I choose an empty pin to generate a random seed, I print ready and then start the
                        LED
                        delay, once the delay ends the program imediatley enters a while loop that will only
                        terminate
                        when the button is pressed. Outside of the while loop once the button is pressed, it will
                        output
                        the total milliseconds it took for you to react to the LED. Lastly, the program waits 5
                        second
                        and starts another round/loop.</p>

                    <h2 class="extra-credit-header header-font">Extra Volt</h2>
                    <p>The first thing I modified for this was adding distinct button state variables. I also
                        removed
                        the mechanism for tracking how much time the reaction was. Once either button has been
                        pressed,
                        and if statement checks which button was pressed and prints a message congradulating the
                        relevant player. The program then waits 5 seconds before starting again.</p>
